# Spic-N-Rice
I have created a static website for restaurant. I used Html, css, and azure static web app and also azure storage accounts. 
In this website you can find the menu of our restaurant , highlights of restaurant and also you can contact us.
I used Azure static web app for hosting and storage accounts for storing the source code.
